This application works in conjunction with the ESP32 microcontroller. This controller receives signals from BLE devices via Bluetooth Low Energy and transmits data to the phone via Bluetooth Classic.
The application allows you to search for new BLE devices that came from the controller or track a specific device. There is also a terminal mode. The data is stored in a SQLite database.
